# Deep Learning Project on Audio Classification

This is a deep learning project that uses Colab notebook, Python, and various deep learning models to classify audio data. The project contains code to run MLP, CNN, and RNN models on the provided data and produce classification results.

# Project Overview
This project aims to classify audio data into different categories using various deep learning models. The project contains the following components:

Colab Notebook: This is the main file that contains all the code for the project. The notebook is self-contained and has all the instructions for running the experiments using MLP, CNN, and RNN models.

Requirements.txt: This file contains all the packages and dependencies required to run the code in the Colab notebook. It includes all the necessary libraries and modules used in the project.

Data: The project contains three data files in JSON format. Two files contain raw data, i.e., MFCCs and labels, and one file contains preprocessed data. The preprocessed file contains MFCCs and labels that are ready to be fed into the models.

Models: This directory contains the code for the MLP, CNN, and RNN models used in the project. Each model is implemented within the colab notebook.

# Running the Project
To run this project, follow these steps:(Note audio data has to be sourced)

Clone the project repository to your local machine.
Open the Colab notebook in a Google Colab environment.
Install all the required packages and dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Upload the data files to the Colab environment.
Run the experiments using the MLP, CNN, and RNN models.
The results of each experiment will be displayed in the notebook.

Final report added as well.
